This repository was created to predict the current players who will make it into the HOF. Here's how my files are broken up. 

1. HOF-predictor-QB.ipynb is my prediction for the quarterback position. 
2. HOF predictor-RB(in progress).ipynb is a notebook I started to predict the RB position, however it is incomplete as I decided to focus my efforts on the QB position.
3. Data-grab.ipynb is a notebook used to web scrap my data. It uses the sportsreference python api to do this. 
4. Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are for working in pipenv to run the code. 
5. Data folder contains all the dataset I worked with on this project.
